# Hi, I'm Denis Krüger

🎓 Information Security Student at THWS Würzburg (4th Semester)  
🛡️ Focused on structured security analysis and practical lab environments

## About Me

I approach cybersecurity through methodical analysis, controlled experimentation, and continuous skill development.  

My interests include:
- Offensive Security
- Privilege Escalation Techniques
- Web Application Security
- IoT & Embedded System Security
- Wireless Security Research

I value understanding *why* an exploit works, not just how to reproduce it.

## Current Projects

- 📚 Structured TryHackMe technical writeups  
- 🕷️ Raspberry Pi-based security research platform  
- 🧠 Expanding hands-on lab environments  

### Tiny mfind (C)

A small reimplementation of the Unix `find` command written in C.  
Includes recursive traversal, basic filtering, and automated tests.
