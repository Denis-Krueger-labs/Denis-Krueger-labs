## About Me

I approach cybersecurity through methodical analysis, controlled experimentation, and continuous skill development.  

My interests include:
- Offensive Security
- Privilege Escalation Techniques
- Web Application Security
- IoT & Embedded System Security
- Wireless Security Research

I value understanding *why* an exploit works, not just how to reproduce it.
