# Hi, I'm Denis Krüger

🎓 Information Security student specializing in offensive security, exploit analysis, and structured attack methodology. 
🛡️ Focused on understanding attack surfaces, chaining vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation in controlled lab environments.

## About Me

I approach offensive security through structured reconnaissance, deep service enumeration, and controlled exploitation in lab environments.
My goal is to understand not only how vulnerabilities are exploited, but how attack chains are constructed end-to-end 

My interests include:
- Web Application Exploitation
- Linux & Windows Privilege Escalation
- Active Directory Fundamentals
- Wireless & Network Attack Surface Analysis
- Embedded & IoT Security
I value understanding *why* an exploit works, not just how to reproduce it.

## Selected Projects

### 🔐 pwgen-lite — Secure CLI Password Generator  
A small Python tool exploring secure randomness, deterministic RNG design,
and brute-force modeling.

Includes entropy estimation, HMAC-based deterministic mode, and a tested CLI interface.

## Security Assessment Workflow

I follow a structured assessment workflow:
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Service Enumeration  
3. Vulnerability Identification  
4. Controlled Exploitation  
5. Privilege Escalation  
6. Post-Exploitation Analysis
7. Documentation & defensive insight extraction
